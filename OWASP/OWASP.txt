OWASP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Injection

What is this?
-------------This is hostile data sent to an interpeter (HTML webpage)

How does it happen?
------------- SQL,NoSQL, queries,ORM queries.

How to fix it?
-------------Keep data seperate from commands.


**Insufficient Logging
What is this?
---------------Attackers typically rely on the lack of monitoring and logging to achieve their goals and to
		those goals without being detected. In 2016, it was found that on average it takes 191 days to
		to perform a identity breach.

How to fix this?
----------------Ensure that all login, access control failures and server-side validation failures are logged accurately
		and effciently to identify any suspiciuos activity.

**Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)

What is this?
-------------------
Three Types of XSS
<<>>Reflected XSS- attacker executes HTML and JS changees. User are usually left vunerable after following untrusted spam links etc.

<<>>Stored XSS- this is when an API stores unsanitized user input that is viewed at a later time.
(physical destruction, hashing data, masking data-)

<<>>DOM XSS- JavaScript f/w, Single-Page apps (SPAs), and APIs that include attacker-controlled data. 
              For instance DOM node replacement, key logging, trojin login panels


How to fix this?
------------------Seperate untrusted data from active browser content
		  Regular and routine destruction of physical data, hashing data(algoritms that hide data and its structure)
		  or masking data(copied data is obsucred)


**Sensitive Data Exposure

What is this?
-----------------------Stealing of clear text data and keys from server while data is in transit or at rest.
			This is also done on a browser as well, not just a server.
			This includes the failure to properly encrypt Sensitive Personal Information(PII).

How to prevent this?
-----------------------Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and data thats in transit.
		       Identify exactly which data types of data is sensitive according to laws and regulations.
		       use up-to-date/strong algorithms and protocols
		       Encrypt data in transit by using TLS(Transport Layer Security) and HSTS(Strict Transport Security)
		       Don't stored sensitve data unneccessarily.
